🎮 **Deep Dive: My Recent Technical Contributions to SpieleZone**

Over the past development cycle, I’ve focused on enhancing both the gameplay experience and the usability of the SpieleZone platform. Here are some highlights of my most impactful changes:

### 🕹️ Game Feature Enhancements

**Hangman**
- Refactored input handling to better support a variety of keyboard keys (including letters, numbers, and symbols).
- Improved the robustness of the game’s event handling, reducing accidental or invalid entries.
- *Note:* Despite several attempts, function keys (like F1–F12) remain an open issue due to browser-level event restrictions and inconsistent cross-platform support.

**2048**
- Fixed a persistent scrolling bug that disrupted gameplay, especially on mobile and touch devices.
- Refined the UI and UX, including animations and tile transitions, for a smoother and more visually appealing experience.
- Enhanced responsiveness and adaptability for different screen sizes, making the game enjoyable on both desktop and mobile.

**Ghost Code**
- Redesigned the game’s interface for clarity and ease of use, updating color schemes and improving accessibility.
- Streamlined the game logic to boost performance and maintainability, with a focus on code readability for future contributors.

### 🧭 Navigation & UI Overhaul

**Navbar**
- Implemented a completely new navigation bar, providing quick access to all major sections and games.
- Designed the component to be modular and responsive, ensuring consistent placement and usability across devices.
- Integrated branding elements and improved the overall look to align with the project’s fun and inviting identity.

**Bottom Bar**
- Added a new bottom bar to enhance user navigation and present contextual information or quick links.
- Ensured both navigation components are accessible and harmoniously styled with the site’s theme.

**General UI**
- Updated CSS and layout logic for a more modern appearance and smoother transitions between sections.
- Removed obsolete files and redundant styles, reducing clutter and technical debt in the codebase.

### 📈 Technical Impact
