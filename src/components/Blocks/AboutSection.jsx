        Hi, I'm Satvik! <strong>Spiele Zone</strong> started as a React.js
        learning project and evolved into a collection of browser-based games
        with a retro twist. I'm passionate about interactive web apps, pixel
        art, and full-stack dev. Stay tuned — more games are on the way!
